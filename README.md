## Description

- A GraphQL API consumed in two applications, one mobile and the other web. In which the main purpose is to control the cases of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the city of Bag√© in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
- Aedes-web: https://github.com/godinhojoao/aedes-web
- Aedes-app: not done yet
- About Aedes Aegypti: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/disease-vectors/facts/mosquito-factsheets/aedes-aegypti

### This API has some features, for example:

- Authentication (under development)
  - Sign up
  - Sign in
- CRUD on some domain models: (under development)
  - Accounts
  - Reports
- Storing data on PostgreSQL database.

### I know that folder structure is not important for architectural reasons. But in this case will be easier to understand the architecture.

### Architecture and folder structure
- Following clean architecture principles, developing the layers separately from each other.
- Domain: The "domain" layer.
- Application: The "application" layer.
- Infra: The "infrastructure" layer.
- Controllers: The "presentation" layer.
